## Best Practices

### General Guidelines
1. **Match style to brand personality** - Ensure the aesthetic aligns with brand values
2. **Consider your audience** - Different demographics respond to different styles
3. **Prioritize accessibility** - Some styles (low contrast, heavy animation) need adjustments
4. **Balance aesthetics with functionality** - Don't sacrifice usability for style
5. **Test with real users** - Validate that the design serves user needs
6. **Maintain consistency** - Apply the style systematically throughout
7. **Consider mobile responsiveness** - Ensure the style works across devices
8. **Think about performance** - Heavy animations and effects impact load times

### Style-Specific Considerations

**Glassmorphism:**
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text readability
- Use sparingly for overlays and cards, not entire layouts

**Neomorphism:**
- Requires careful contrast management for accessibility
- Works best for small UI elements, not large layouts

**Dark Mode:**
- Provide adequate contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)
